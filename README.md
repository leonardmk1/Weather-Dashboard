# Weather-Dashboard

Using the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities, I have build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.  I have set up the page to use local storage to capture searched data.

### User Story

AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly.
